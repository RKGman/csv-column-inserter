# csv-column-inserter
C# WPF Application for Inserting a Column in a CSV.

The application defaults to using the file name as the value of the new column.

Currently the application only inserts to the last column.

This is primarily for demonstration of knowledge on MVVM Design, Object-Oriented Design, and C# Style Documentation.


I am always open to ideas and suggestions.


Desired features (plan moving forward):
1. Specifying the column index where to insert.
2. Verification and insertion progress bar (useful for larger files).
3. Options for inserting values? (For example: Enumeration) <- Perhaps it can accept a query of some sort?
